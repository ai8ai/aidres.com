  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

  <p>Last updated: <strong>Oct 16, 2025</strong></p>

  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to the mobile application <strong>Asian Girls Gallery Wallpapers</strong> (package name: <code>com.aixpertlab.asianbeautyycc</code>), developed and maintained by <strong>aiDres.com</strong>.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collection</h2>
  <p>
    Our app may collect and process limited user information through Google Firebase and Google AdMob services to improve functionality, stability, and overall user experience. 
    We do not sell, rent, or share your personal information with third parties for marketing purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Firebase Services Used</h2>

  <h3>1. Firebase Authentication</h3>
  <p>
    If you choose to sign in or create an account, we may use Firebase Authentication to securely handle your login credentials. Firebase Authentication may collect identifiers such as your email address or Google account ID solely for authentication purposes.
  </p>

  <h3>2. Firebase Analytics</h3>
  <p>
    We use Firebase Analytics to better understand how users interact with our app. This service may collect information such as device type, operating system, app usage, and interactions (e.g., screen views, button taps). This data is used in aggregate form to improve app performance and user experience.
  </p>

  <h3>3. Firebase Crashlytics</h3>
  <p>
    We use Firebase Crashlytics to identify, diagnose, and fix technical issues. Crashlytics automatically collects crash reports, device information (such as device model and operating system), and app performance data. This helps us maintain app stability and deliver a smoother experience.
  </p>

  <h3>4. Cloud Firestore</h3>
  <p>
    We may use Cloud Firestore to securely store non-sensitive app-related data (such as user preferences, app settings, or gallery information). Any data stored in Firestore is transmitted securely and protected under Firebase's security infrastructure.
  </p>

  <h3>5. Google AdMob</h3>
  <p>
    We use Google AdMob to display banner and interstitial advertisements within our app. AdMob may collect and use certain data, including your deviceâ€™s advertising ID, IP address, approximate location, and interactions with ads, to deliver personalized or non-personalized ads.
  </p>

    </a>
  </p>
  <p>
    If you are in the European Economic Area (EEA), the app will request your consent before showing personalized ads, in compliance with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). 
    You can change your ad preferences at any time through your device settings.
  </p>

  <h2>Third-Party Links</h2>
  <p>
    This app includes a voluntary "Buy Me a Coffee" link that directs users to our Ko-fi page at 
    <a href="https://ko-fi.com/seief" target="_blank">https://ko-fi.com/seief</a>. 
    This link opens in an external browser, and all donations are handled outside of the app through Ko-fi's secure platform.
  </p>
  <p>
    We do not access or store any information related to your donations. For more information, please refer to Ko-fi's privacy policy:  
    <a href="https://ko-fi.com/privacy" target="_blank">https://ko-fi.com/privacy</a>
  </p>

  <h2>Data Security</h2>
  <p>
    We take data protection seriously. All Firebase and AdMob services are provided by Google and secured with industry-standard encryption and authentication. While we take reasonable precautions to protect your data, no method of transmission over the Internet is 100% secure.
  </p>

  <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    Our app is not directed to children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children. If you believe your child has provided personal information, please contact us so we can take appropriate action.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted within the app and on this page with a revised "Last updated" date.
  </p>
