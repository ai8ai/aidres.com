  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated:</strong> January 19, 2026</p>

  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
    Nod: Daily Safety Check-In is designed to help users, including seniors,
    confirm their daily well-being. The app collects and stores limited personal
    data solely to provide its safety check-in and emergency notification
    functionality.
  </p>

  <h2>Data Collected</h2>
  <p>The app may collect and store the following information:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>User-provided name</li>
    <li>Device identifier (used for identification without account registration)</li>
    <li>Emergency contact email address</li>
    <li>Check-in timestamps</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Data Is Used</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>To record daily check-ins initiated by the user</li>
    <li>To determine whether a check-in has been missed for 48 hours</li>
    <li>
      To send an email notification to the assigned emergency contact if a
      check-in is missed
    </li>
    <li>To associate check-in data with a device without requiring login or registration</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>How Data Is Stored</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>
      Data is stored securely in Google Firebase Firestore, a cloud database
      service operated by Google.
    </li>
    <li>
      The device identifier is used only to distinguish users and does not grant
      access to other device data.
    </li>
    <li>
      No personal data is used for advertising, tracking, or analytics.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Automated Processing &amp; Notifications</h2>
  <p>
    An automated background process runs periodically to check whether a user
    has missed a check-in for 48 hours.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      If a missed check-in is detected, an email notification is sent to the
      designated emergency contact.
    </li>
    <li>
      This process is executed using scheduled automation (GitHub Actions).
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Email Delivery</h2>
  <p>
    Emergency notification emails are sent using Brevo, an external email
    delivery service.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>
      The emergency contact email address is shared with Brevo solely for the
      purpose of sending notification emails.
    </li>
    <li>
      Brevo processes email data according to its own privacy and security
      practices.
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    Personal data is shared only as required to provide the app’s core
    functionality:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Google Firebase Firestore for secure data storage</li>
    <li>Brevo for sending emergency notification emails</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
    No personal data is sold or shared for marketing, advertising, or tracking
    purposes.
  </p>

  <h2>Internet Usage</h2>
  <p>
    Internet access is required to store check-in data and to send emergency
    notification emails. The app does not perform background analytics or
    unrelated data collection.
  </p>

  <h2>Permissions</h2>
  <p>
    The app does not request access to sensitive device permissions such as:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Camera</li>
    <li>Location</li>
    <li>Contacts</li>
    <li>Microphone</li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Data Retention &amp; Deletion</h2>
  <p>
    Data is retained only for as long as necessary to provide the app’s
    functionality. Users may delete all stored data by uninstalling the app or
    by contacting the developer.
  </p>

  <h2>Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    This app is not intended for use by children under the age of 18 and does
    not knowingly collect personal information from children.
  </p>

  <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This privacy policy may be updated if new features or services are
    introduced. Any changes will be reflected on this page.
